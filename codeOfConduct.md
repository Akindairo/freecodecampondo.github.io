Free Code Camp Ondo
=======================
# Code of Conduct

Free Code Camp events are community events intended for networking and collaboration as well as learning. We value the participation of every member of the programming community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the events and in interactions online associated with our study group.

To make clear what is expected, everyone taking part in Free Code Camp Ondo events and discussionsâ€”instructors, helpers, organizers, and learners are all required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. 

### The Short Version

 - Study Group is dedicated to providing a harassment-free learning experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or choice of text editor. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.
 - All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event.
 - Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees.
 - Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

### The Longer Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you.


As you can clearly see, there is only one rule :

## BE NICE!
